# Sector Labs Gists Displayer

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

THe project uses Bootstrap for the Badges of the file language.

The Github API has a number of maximum calls per hour. This requires attention, as I exceeded this number while testing. The application should be more careful with the calls.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
